# Discord Bot Status

## Current Status
✅ Bot is authorized and running in Discord server
✅ Bot responds to slash commands  
✅ Server is running on port 3004
❌ DMA manual is NOT loaded (manualLoaded: false)

## Why Inaccurate Answers?

The bot is working BUT it's using general knowledge instead of your DMA manual because:

1. **Google Drive API not configured** - The bot needs Google Drive API credentials to fetch the manual
2. The bot falls back to general yacht charter knowledge when the manual isn't available
3. This means responses are generic, not specific to your DMA manual

## What Needs to be Fixed

### Option 1: Configure Google Drive API (Recommended)

1. Get Google Drive API credentials:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create a project or select existing
   - Enable Google Drive API
   - Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID)
   - Download credentials

2. Update `.env` with:
   ```
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

3. Restart server

### Option 2: Use Mock Data for Testing

For testing quality checks without Google Drive, we can use the mock data that's already in GoogleDriveService.

## Running Quality Tests

To run quality comparison tests against MoGPT:

```bash
npm run test:discord-quality
```

Note: Tests will also be affected by the manual not loading, but will still compare bot responses to MoGPT.

## Current Configuration

- ✅ Discord Bot Token: Configured
- ✅ Discord Client ID: Configured  
- ✅ Discord Guild ID: Configured
- ✅ DMA Manual Doc ID: 1D1gm6kjPGi-7uvdMQT9rt6ES8DpMI7WStv14Tpi8VtI
- ✅ OpenAI API Key: Configured
- ❌ Google Drive Credentials: NOT Configured

## Test the Bot

Try these in your Discord server:
```
/help
/ask question: What are the safety procedures?
/manual-search query: booking
```

The bot will respond, but answers will be generic yacht charter knowledge, not specific to your DMA manual.
